title =  "About Me"
+++

I'm Jeff and I work as the Director of IT at
    <a href="https://www.infoquant.com">infoQuant</a> where I manage
    product deployments and perform software development.
    As time permits, I provide freelance web development and consulting.
    When not working, I still get my geek on with arduino and other maker projects. Basically, I enjoy
    creating things. 


You can reach me <a href="/contact"><strong>via email</strong></a>,
    <a href="https://www.github.com/jeffsmithdev">github</a> and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsmithdev/">linkedin</a>.
